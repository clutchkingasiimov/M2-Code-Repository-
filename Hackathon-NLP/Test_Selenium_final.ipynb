When I went to book, it said my $300+ in travel funds is no longer valid. Even though the majority of the purchase in December (a month ago) was paid directly, a small portion was previous travel funds. Now the purchase I made a month ago is only good until 4/13. To add insult, the new travel dates I have are 4/23-4/27, but I was told by customer service that it's unfortunate my travel is after the date.  You would think years of loyalty would have some impact. At the very least a sympathetic ear instead of the rude, scripted response I received. Don't believe the large advertisements that you can use your funds for 12 months. As I was told, I should have read the small print instead of the billboard.

Our flight was canceled, which with all the cancellations happening we weren't surprised. I called Southwest Airlines and was told that since I had booked though the Vacation portal I had to deal with them.  I waited on hold for over 6 hours (after being hung up on once and transferred to the wrong number twice). The person on the phone said my airfare was approved to be refunded, but they would have to contact the hotel since it was day of. I don't really get that part since it was Southwest who canceled my flight, but he told me it was standard protocol and I would hear back by end of day the next day.  3 days later I still hadn't heard anything, so I called again. After waiting on hold for over 2 hours I was told that they still hadn't heard back from the hotel on the refund. Could I please call back in another 2 days. I called back 2 days later, and after being on hold for over an hour, the guy answered, told me his system was locked up and I would have to call back. So I tried the chat option, which they tout on their hold line is a great option to get service. The person on chat told me they were still waiting on the hotel. So I asked when the airfare portion was going to be returned and they responded that they couldn't help me with that, I would have to call.  Every day I try to call or chat and I keep being told they are waiting for the hotel to get back to them, they can't tell me when the airfare portion is being refunded and to please be patient and wait for 2 more days. It has been 8 days since my first call and still nothing. At this point I don't even think they have contacted the hotel, I don't think they are going to refund my airfare and I think they are waiting for me to give up.

We needed to arrive in Denver in time for a 4-8PM welcome dinner, so we booked a flight that landed at 2:20PM thinking that would give us plenty of time. As we were en route to the Atlanta airport, we received a notification that our flight was delayed an hour, which was inconvenient, but a Southwest representative informed us that there were no earlier flights available for us to switch to so we figured we could still make it work and just be a little late to the dinner. Then when we were about 2 hours in to our 2.5 hour flight, the captain announced that we could not land in Denver because of bad weather and instead needed to divert to Albuquerque to refuel. We were not informed of this until we were practically on the ground in NM, and what we were initially told would be a 20-minute refueling turned into over an hour delay in Albuquerque. We did not land in Denver until nearly 7PM local time, at which point we had completely missed the wedding event that we flew in for  had we known we would not be able to attend the welcome dinner, we would have flown in Sunday morning for the wedding instead and saved hundreds of dollars in lodging and rental car fees. To add insult to injury, everyone we spoke to in Denver was baffled by our story because they claimed there were clear skies in Denver all day  no severe weather at all that would have prevented our flight from landing on time! Even assuming there was severe weather that all of those people somehow missed, Im guessing we could have avoided it had we departed at our original scheduled time; alternately, had the plan been adequately gassed-up in the first place, we would not have needed to divert to Albuquerque resulting in a further multi-hour delay.

If you are a reasonable person who travels by air, you can't be surprised when things aren't going smoothly. However, my experience with this flight was absolutely horrible. The flight was continually being delayed which yes, I understand. Boarding finally took place at approximately 3:20 as the plane was scheduled to ultimately take off around 3:44. Boarding had been completed. It was a very FULL flight. Apparently, the ground crew was still trying to get the bags loaded on the plane so further delays ensued. We sat until approximately 4:30 in a closed plane with little to no air circulation and again I emphasize a CHOCK FULL FLIGHT. All this as a PANDEMIC is still happening !!!!! Why air cannot be pumped into the plane in these circumstances is a concern! If that is not possible, there should be at least some type of plan B for circumstances like this while the country is still experiencing pandemic like conditions. It was IRRESPONSIBLE, UNCONSCIONABLE AND HORRIBLE! Southwest should be compensating every single person on that flight. Often, the captain will stand at the exit as passengers disembark.

            "['Why do people like this airline?', 'Date of travel: August 2021', '45', b'Southwest gets lots of positive reviews, but I really don\\'t understand why. If you\\'re not checking luggage, they cost roughly the same as any other airline, and the experience was definitely worse.  The only reasonable connection Southwest offered between San Francisco and Minneapolis had me first stop in Burbank (remaining on the plane) and the changing planes in Phoenix. So I flew three segments on this trip, and none of them was enjoyable. The experience at the airports was even worse than on the planes.  I absolutely despise Southwest\\'s bizarre boarding procedure. I paid extra for \"early bird check-in\", which gave me a boarding number on their \"A\" list. Even so, I had to wait a LONG time amid chaotic crowds at the airport and then race like the running of the bulls to board the plane. Even with that, on one of my flights I still had to stow my bag in another row. That\\'s because even though I chose a row that was empty when I boarded, the overhead bins in that row were already filled.  Both of the planes I flew on were old and filthy. I know from the layover in Burbank that Southwest doesn\\'t clean the planes at all when they stop. They didn\\'t even spray or wipe down surfaces. All the flight attendants did was check to make sure the safety cards were still in the seat pockets. This is probably because Southwest tries to turn their planes in a shorter time than other airlines do. When it\\'s 45 minutes or less between touchdown and take-off, there\\'s not much cleaning that can be done.  On all three legs the only service was a tiny package of snack mix and a tiny cup of a non-alcoholic beverage. The flight attendants came across as rude and indifferent, as if they were doing us a big favor to be handing out that tiny treat. They said there was wi-fi available, but it didn\\'t seem to work on any of the flights.  There were lots of children on all my flights, and many of them misbehaved badly. (One little girl spent the entire flight kicking my seat.) Neither their parents nor the flight attendants corrected them in any way.  When I landed in Phoenix I found that my onward flight to Minneapolis had been delayed. No Southwest employee ever gave a reason for this delay, and they acted annoyed that I had even inquired. We ended up 3 1/2 hours late, which got us into MSP around 3am. There were absolutely no apologies given--not by the gate staff, not by the pilots, and not by the flight attendants. Honestly, they were some of the least pleasant airline employees I\\'ve ever dealt with--definitely not who you want when there\\'s a delay.  I e-mailed Southwest after this experience. Their response still had no apology whatsoever and no explanation for the delay. They did, however \"as a gesture of good faith\" give me a small credit for future travel.

Thanks for the pandemic understanding NOT!!', 'Date of travel: December 2020', '45', b\"SO I feel like we are still in the middle of a pandemic, right?? Or am I mistaken and we have moved on completely? Either way , large corporate entities, such as Southwest Airlines clearly have....hopefully that government bailout helped your employees at least. Once again the customer always deals with the loss and the corporations grow wealthier. I had no choice last holiday season and wasn't allowed to travel to see my family. I had to cancel the flight and tried not too, but travel bans in the northeast prevented me from going. Additionally, no vaccines were readily available and I would put my family at risk. So with the flexibility that all the airlines were shouting in the streets I presumed I had a year to figure it out. Not so with Southwest (I am sure other airlines suck too). I went to go use the funds and was informed that they expire before I am able to travel and it was a year from when they were purchased. The best part is you have to travel before that expiration date, not purchased. Of course the modern method to saving money is 'get them as early as possible' so kind of useless unless you travel all the time. They also informed me that any Covid-19 policies had expired last September???? The heart of the pandemic, when numbers were starting to climb back up?? We all had to sacrifice and suffer loss this last year and five months, yet it seems that corporate America is stronger than ever. I will find a way to use these funds and not give Southwest another dime to contribute to their millions, rather than let them pocket $100 of it (penalty for expiration) and use the rest on their currently overpriced tickets. I was always a loud advocator for this airline, and throughout the years went out of my way to use them. No longer, as there are many other choices. One day consumers will hopefully figure out that we have all the control, but most likely not. Thanks for nothing Southwest, here is hoping y'all go bankrupt!\", 'Southwest-Airlines.hmtl']\n",

            "['Southwest Has Gone Down the Drain', 'Date of travel: August 2021', '45', b'(Note: the worst part is near the end of the review.) Pre-pandemic I was always flying Southwest with my family. I loved the free bags and no extra fees. I always had great customer service too. I used to recommend Southwest to everyone. Well let me tell you, no more! Their service, quality, and customer care has gone down the drain! I finally got to visit my family this summer after a year and a half of not seeing most of them due to the pandemic. Myself and my three boys traveled to our destination via American Airlines. Had no issues there - great service and a nice plane! On the way back, however, I traveled via Southwest. Unbeknownst to me they had changed my nonstop flight to a flight with one stop in Orlando. I found this out when checking on my flight a few days before. Now in their defense, I searched my email and they had notified me of this change back in the beginning of May via an email that I am fairly certain ended up in my promotions folder instead of my inbox or else I would have seen it. The thing that urked me is that they made this change the day after I bought my 3 nonstop tickets. The day after their sale ended, they decided to get rid of a bunch of nonstop flights. How convenient for them... Not so much all of us who booked with them because we wanted a nonstop flight. I was hoping they had one this week that I could change it to, but nope. Checked their website - none. Now mind you, I was traveling alone with three boys. My oldest is 6 and the other two are both under the age of 2 (a 21 month old and a 6 month old). If you are a parent, you understand how difficult this could be. I waited on hold for almost 2 hours just for them to tell me they could refund my tickets, but if I used flight credit it would stay as flight credit (not helpful as they have no nonstop flights on this route anymore). They said they \"temporarily\" got rid of nonstop flights from their schedule. I looked at my options for the week and either the layovers were way too short to make it to the other plane for us or they were long and required even more flight time. Needless to say, I had to keep my flight. By then other airlines were too expensive and Southwest said they could not book us on another airline. I was told this before I even asked so you know a bunch of people must have asked this. I haven\\'t gotten to the worst part yet.. We had a fine first flight to Orlando. A little over two hours. They kept changing the time but ended up boarding on time after all. We made it to Orlando and our stroller was already waiting for us when we got off the plane. Kudos to Orlando people. Flying to Dallas was a different story. We were sitting in the plane an hour before we took off. This was due to the weather, so that, I understand. This was another 2 and a half hour flight as well. My poor kids were doing fairly well despite traveling all day. (Remember, two of them are a young toddler and a baby.) Near the end of the flight while we had been traveling for over 11 hours already one of the flight attendants remarks about the mess we had made (my toddler spilled some chip crumbs on the floor) and said that we would have to clean it up, but she said it in a passive aggressive way and asked if we needed a trash bag. While I told her \"okay\" I don\\'t think she heard me because she said, \"I will get you a trash bag,\" like it was a mission of hers. She never ended up bringing the trash bag. Now mind you, I have a baby on my lap that is still learning how to sit up well on his own and a young toddler that I am trying to keep entertained so he stays in his seat and my 6 yr old is napping. But she expects me to bend down in the tiny space where our legs go while holding a baby to pick up crumbs. Really? When my 6 year old woke up I made sure he helped me and we quickly threw away all of our trash including stuff on the floor as the attendants went by quickly with the trash bags. (Side rant: Why do they always go by so fast even when they see you still trying to gather trash?) Needless to say, we left some chip crumbs on the floor and some fell in between the seats (which already were dirty with other people\\'s crumbs so I wasn\\'t reaching in there). When we got off of the plane I was waiting with the boys for my stroller with the baby attached to me in a wrap. There was one other family with their daughter waiting too by the time I got my stroller. As I am unfolding my double stroller with the baby attached to me and making sure my toddler doesn\\'t run off, the flight attendant who never brought me the trash bag comes off of the plane and said that I left a huge mess and it was rude of me because they have nothing to clean it up with and as I was saying, \"You never brought me a trash bag,\" (which was the only reponse my flabbergasted mind could come up with), she just kept walking and ignored me. WOW.. The mom in the other family waiting for a stroller was like, \"Really?!\" She couldn\\'t believe how rude that flight attendant was to me while she sees me struggling to juggle my kids and our stuff and stroller while traveling all day by myself (my husband had to stay in TX and work). I am generally a nice person okay, and if she had brought me a trash bag like she said she was, even though she was rude, I would have had my 6 yr old son help me clean up the floor hoping I didn\\'t squish the baby while bending over in that small space with him and doing her job for her. Is it my fault Southwest makes flight attendants clean the plane? Isn\\'t that part of your job? Is it my fault they don\\'t give you guys hand vacuums? So besides the super rude, unsympathetic flight attendant who must have never been a mother, and Southwest getting rid of all of their nonstop flights from Philly to Dallas (and who knows where else), Southwest does not do the amount of COVID cleaning they claim they do. Both planes were dirty and the first one I was on had dirty tray tables that I made sure and wiped off and sanitized for all of us. Southwest is skimping on their cleaning procedures because they are turning over planes at such a quick rate. They just care about the all-mighty dollar. They don\\'t seem to care about their customers anymore. It is a real shame. Southwest, I used to love you, I used to always fly you, but now I must say goodbye.

I have generally enjoyed flying SWA prior to Covid and actually have their CC. I travel frequently for work and fly numerous airlines, and SWA has always been in the top few. However, this recent trip was a totally different experience.  While other airlines (Delta, JetBlue) have taken to improving cleanliness and taking measures to sanitize between flights, SWA could not even clean up the food and trash left behind from the previous flight. The four planes I flew in were absolutely disgusting. I used some leftover wipes from a previous Delta flight to clean my sticky dirty tray tables and seats. The family across from me showed me the massive amount of food that was crushed up under their seats that was just left there. They made the point that the plane sat for 3-4 hours during the delay, and the least that could have been done was to take a little time to clean it up.  The overall communication and service was horrendous. All of the flights I was on departed late and we would not receive prompt communication of delays until it was far beyond useful. The last flight was canceled altogether after 6 hours of being strung along, despite known computer issues. We were lied to by crews that it was due to weather and that the pilots were over their time just as we were sitting on the runway to take off for a 45 min final flight. We could not get our bags back and were told they would arrive sometime at our final destination. Myself and my fellow traveler were rebooked on two separate flights one and two days later, respectively. We ended up cancelling the final flight altogether and driving 6 hours home to avoid any more of this frustration.  Overall, the experience I had is probably not unique and should be noted if SWA wants to retain previously loyal customers. Extremely terrible and disappointing. Our bags are still lost and we been told we will not be refunded for the issues.

My family and I had the worst experience imaginable. So we have all heard of people getting kicked off flights because their 2-year-old would not leave their mask on, Well guess what!! I was welcomed to that small group of parents who travel with their 2-year-old and was demanded to either hold him (as if he has a straight jacket) and keep his mask on or get kicked off the flight. To make matters worse, there was another family who had a child the same age if not older as mine and they (being the main flight attendant) never asked or required both of their children to wear masks. Which is really disappointing because now with her not enforcing it for the whole flight, my wife and I both felt and still feel targeted due to us being an interracial couple with a mixed 2yr old child.  Let's be honest, I get the federal laws in place to protect us all, but let's put it into perspective. Can a 2-year-old count to 20? Can they say their complete ABC's? Let alone use the restroom by themselves? The answer to most if not all these questions is NO, so how do you expect every child a day over 2 to perform a simple task like wearing a mask efficiently or even at all? Lastly, if you are going to enforce it, make sure the whole flight is also given the option to force their children to wear their masks or get left halfway to their destination, at least this way no one feels targeted and the rule is consistent across all CUSTOMERS and not certain ethnicities.  #southwestairlines #airsouthwest\", 'Southwest-Airlines.hmtl']\n",

Ten -fourteen day quarantine if you were coming into the state. I was going to stay in a hotel, not with family. I cancelled everything. My trip was only for 6 days. I was not vaccinated. I had converted my Luv voucher once. When I called to see about using these funds and the cash funds I was told that the voucher could not be converted again so I would lose that money and the cash if I didn't travel by the 22nd. Having just been vaccinated and the state just re-opening this isn't reasonable for me. At this point the cash can be converted for $100 which leaves me with $88.76 from my original $467.00. I was told, that is too bad. That is our policy. The rep I spoke with told me you could have still made your trip, we were flying into the state of California even though it was shut down for essential business only. So, that is your problem.

Back story - Nick suffers from crippling claustrophobia as part of his PTSD. Anyway. We didn\\'t do or say anything, and they stopped for about 2 minutes and had normal conversation but started up with the insults again out of nowhere. So this time I told the lady, \"He has PTSD from serving in the military on submarines.

Southwest switched several months ago to allow middle row seating. For us, we were fine because there were five of us and we took up an entire row. It was not a completely full flight so the one empty seat remaining on the row was empty the whole time. I was on the side of the plane with my wife and daughter.  In my experience, Southwest\\'s customer service is far superior to other legacy airlines and also low cost airlines. Their flight attendants are friendly but do enforce the rules - especially regarding mask usage. Their rules regarding the way they seat their passengers takes a little getting used to but I am comfortable with it and have not had a problem keeping our party together during flights.  For those unhappy with a seat next to them being occupied, I feel your pain but if you don\\'t buy an extra seat that spot is fair game and you should expect to have a person sitting next to you.  The best part about Southwest is their baggage and rescheduling flexibility. COVID may have prompted some other airlines to temporarily loosen their change fees, but Southwest has never had them. Also being able to check two bags is wonderful. If prices are close, I will always go with Southwest, especially due to the lack of change fees. COVID caused us to have to reschedule this more than once and SW was very accommodating and didn\\'t charge us half the price of the ticket to make a change (zero $$ change fee) It is nice to fly with an airline where I don\\'t feel like the customers are hated or at least taken for granted.  Another nice feature is they seem to have more non-stop flights than many other airlines, mainly because they have less reliance on \"hub cities\" and instead rely more on point to point flights. We did have an automated reschedule prior to flying that booked a connecting flight after our original flight was cancelled, but they cheerfully booked us back on a non-stop when my wife called weeks before the flight date.

The stewardesses past by 3 times and said nothing. The person has bottle of soda on his tray table that he was sipping every 5 minutes or so. Also, his tray table was down with a tablet playing a movie all through takeoff. After an hour or so I went up to speak to the stewardesses and i got 'they are allowed to if they are eating or drinking'. I pushed and she said she'd speak to him. After that the passengert wore his mask the rest of the flight, but why did I need to speak up to get the policy enforced. Also another passenger had his mask only over his mouth the entire flight. This saddens me as I have enjoyed flying with Southwest for decades.\", 'Southwest-Airlines.hmtl']\n",

Tickets were always priced at the same amount as competitors, yet Southwest was the only airline offering free checked baggage (2 per person!) meaning for our travels, with a suitcase each, for myself and my partner price-wise this airline was by far the best option. Their app is very useful for check-in and keeping updated on flight status, gate changes etc. Online check-in was a breeze, we never paid for priority-boarding/early-bird; Southwest operate a 'open-seating' policy so the earlier you check-in, the earlier you board and the more choice you have, however on all but one flight we managed to find two seats together despite being lower B group (just ensure you check-in quickly when it opens online 24 hours prior to departure). The seats always looked clean, although having been on two continuing flights (where you remain on board), it was evident that they didn't do too much cleaning between services which could be improved (though hopefully given the virus pandemic they have increased their cleaning standards). Check-in physically at the airports was also simple with the self-serve kiosks, and we didn't once have to wait in a line. Overall, I think 5 out of 6 of our flights departed and arrived almost exactly on time. I had one cancelled flight but this was due to the airport closing as a result of inclement weather, and through the Southwest app I managed to contact a customer representative and still get to my destination later in the day on a different flight once the fog had cleared and the airport was open again.

Departure time was 1:55pm, arriving BUR at 3:10pm. At 12:32pm, I received a text message from Southwest with a new departure time (3:05pm). Then within minutes another text from them with a departure time of 4:00pm. A few minutes later another text with departure time change of 3:30pm. Then, minutes after that, another text that the flight was cancelled. Absolutely unacceptable! There were NO weather issues in San Francisco at the time. The agent at the gate said it was \"likely due to weather, possibly regarding the aircraft that was arriving from another airport\". That is hard to believe, since the flight was cancelled less than 2 hours before departure from SFO. Also, it couldn\\'t possibly be a mechanical issue because the aircraft we were supposed to be boarding wasn\\'t at the gate, and because it was so close to our scheduled departure time, the aircraft supposedly coming from another location had to have either already been in flight, or never left the ground. This is Christmas Eve. Most people flying on this day have very important commitments and family gatherings. There was no offer to fly on another airline. No other Southwest flights were apparently available to depart out of SFO. There was NO compensation offered, not even shuttle service to another airport. The only option for me was to get rerouted to Las Vegas then from LAS to BUR. The SFO-LAS flight didn\\'t depart until 4:55pm and connecting flight got me into BUR at 9:15pm! That\\'s 6 hours later than when I needed to arrive. I was unable to see family members I have not seen in over 2 years due to completely missing a very special holiday gathering. It was the ONLY time I could have seen these family members, and I missed it. It will likely be another 1 to 2 years before I will see them again. This is tragic, and all because (I came to find out) Air Traffic Control instructed Southwest to cancel this flight on Christmas Eve within less than 2 hours of departure. So, it was an issue with air traffic, not weather. ATC cancelled this flight probably due to departing and arriving aircraft congestion at SFO. I never received any communication from Southwest about this. Not a word of apology, nothing about the reason for this cancellation, not a single offer of compensation. I will tell you that in the future, I will NOT book a holiday flight with Southwest Airlines again.

The website deceivingly shows this as an actual hotel, not a motel. It has open hallways with windows facing the street that is extremely loud and unsafe. The walls are paper thin to the point I can hear the conversation in the room next to me. It has a police officers sitting lobby for security which is an immediate red flag.

My wife and I had planned a much needed vacation to the South Pacific months in advance, with a once a week departure out of Los Angeles on Air New Zealand. We used Southwest to get us from Salt Lake City to LAX-namely because they had the best fares and there were no baggage fees. Weve flown SWA many times before domestically, although they arent exclusively the airline we have chosen. That may change after our excellent experience with SWA.  The day we left to the airport in SLC was chaotic and we rushed to get out the door. In the panic, my wife had left her insulin pump at home! We did not discover this until moments before the plane departed the gate (we were already seated).  We had no choice but to get off the plane and figure something out. The departing flight from LAX was leaving in six hours. Honestly, I thought the vacation was going to be canceled as our travel insurance was not going to cover the costs of re-routing us through New Zealand to the Cook Islands.  SWA immediately stepped into action and the customer representative began making plans (and contingency plans) on how to get both of us to LAX in a timely fashion. I wish I had written her name down. She was extremely sympathetic when we explained the situation and within 30 minutes I was on my way. My wife (who had to wait to have her insulin pump delivered to the airport) was on her way within an hour and a half. We both met up in Los Angeles with time to spare.  I cant say enough good things about the way the customer rep handled the situation.

We needed to get away fro Milwaukee to Phoenix for not only warmer weather, but, also a change of pace. We booked a flight to Phoenix in November, for a January 27th flight, purchasing Southwests EARLY BIRD, thinking my sweet would be able to handle the terminal and TSA. As it happened we needed her wheelchair to get to the gate. At check-in, we were told that because we were early we wouldnt have any problem getting a bulkhead seat which mtsweet needed (the extra legroom). We we the only ones at the gate, a good three hours before the flight, and when the gate agent arrived (about half an hour before board time), she acknowledged our being there and our need, so we felt secure. All things changed when a young Southwest employee (male), showed up and at boarding let it be known that all those who could walk with Pre-boarding on their thicket could board, but only those who could walk, no one who needed assistance (wheelchairs included). My sweetie was beside herself - why have pre-boarding for those who could walk, and not for wheelchair dependent. Incensed, my sweet argued briefly with that young man who said there was no first come first served at Southwest, despite their early bird program, as well as pre-board program. This gate person was belligerent, and not at all caring. The upshot being that my Sweet struggled to get out of the wheelchair and declared she was walking, despite her boot and unsteadiness, leaving me behind to do whatever I could with her chair and that gate person. It seems that this gate person, and maybe Southwest have no regard for those who need assistance onto the plane, as well as access to seats with room (at the front of the plane - walkers with Pre-board would likely take those prime seats, those depriving those who need them to the cramped seating more aft on the plane. We have always observed those in wheelchairs being the first to be boarded, but we were deprived of our one time need. I hope this was a one time occurrence because this young man did not like older people with Pre-boarding needs approved by his own employer. Southwest has always been a favorite of ours, but this is causing us to re-think our position. My Sweetie managed to hobble her way to a bulkhead aisle, and our flight was uneventful afterwards, with the wheelchair being delivered to the jetway with Im minutes after our arrival in Phoenix.', 'Southwest-Airlines.hmtl']\n",

When I got my boarding passes we were still almost the last to board - on both legs. On leg two we could not even sit at the same end of the airplane. The next day I emailed a complaint to SW. They acknowledged my complaint in a return email the next day. When it was tie to fly back I figured why bother? The night before the return flight I received an email from SW telling me that they were refunding the $50 and apologized for the mix up. That did impress me. However, that is not what impressed me the most. The night before my wife went to bed early, feeling queasy. In the AM she said she felt better but not 100% yet. While waiting 4 hours to board we went to mid terminal to have a drink and a bite. She ordered a martini. As she was finishing it I suggested that she cut herself off as she was not herself. She ordered another anyway. A while after that arrived I left for 10 minutes to change clothes. When I returned her drink, and glass, we're gone. And so was she - mentally. Never seen anything like that before. I had to physically help her to gate 8. There she sat trying to sleep. Then we were notified we had to go to Gate 6. I think she was worse at this time and it was a struggle to get her to the gate area. When it was time to get in line I had to help her while we dragged 2 carry ons. FINALLY made it in to the plane where the flight crew approached me about my wife and that we shouldn't make the flight to Baltimore. I said we would thinking that she would be sober in 4.5 hours. 10 minutes before flight time they asked us off the plane. Here is where it gets good. Outside the planes entrance was a flight attendant with a wheel chair, plus another staff to take our carry ons. They walked all the way to the luggage area with us and retrieved our bags (now its 5 total) and then took us to see the SW medic. He told me how to feed and water my wife for best results in handling too much alcohol. Then the two flight attendants - both women - walked us thru customs and then to the waiting van that I called. These women also had mad arrangements for us to catch the same flight the next day - all at no charge. I don't think that we will ever fly another airline than SouthWest (unless they don't go where we need to go). That was a class act. FYI - I got Sheryle back to the apartment (I called the owner for OK) and she was in bed by 6:00pm. She didn't get up until 19:00am the next morning - 16 straight hours asleep - and felt good enough to walk but still had the upset stomach and headache - and then added a runny nose.

On Saturday 12/21/19 I checked in at Atlanta airport at 5:29AM for the 6:15AM flight from ATL to HOU at a kiosk. The machine lagged so the process was not complete before the 45 minutes cut off. I proceeded to the front counter and was politely helped by the staff there to check in. the service on the plane was also just as pleasant. However when I got to Houston is where it all began. I was only able to retrieve one of the two luggage. When I tried to inquire about the other, I was told by the representative there that because the luggage was a \"late check\" it may be on the next direct flight which will land in 4 hours. I thanked the person and waited. when the luggage finally came I was appalled at the sight. this particular luggage was a gift from my wife so I treasured it with love. I bought a fabric luggage cover to protect it from scratches which I know is unavoidable with use. what I saw was my sentimental luggage tattered, stripped naked of its cover, with scratches and dents on the top, and a broken top handle. I did not open the luggage but went straight to the baggage claim office to file a report and check the content there.  The first question the representative there asked by was \"are you sure the handle was not broken before\". I explained to her this is a gift from my wife and I had a fabric cover on it. now it is naked, dented, and broken. she then ask me again if I was sure the handle was not broken before. I may understand the policy of asking but why ask twice; and completely ignored the fact the luggage is dented and naked. Upon opening the luggage I found the cover inside of the luggage. She then ask if I want repair or replacement. I again repeated how important this luggage is to me and would be delighted if she can repair it. after inquiring with her colleague, she tell me it must be replaced and ask what brand it is. then in the middle of the crowed room exclaimed \"oh your luggage is a no brand name\". not once did I get an apology for the anguish of not knowing where a sentimental treasured item is, the heartbreak of seeing it tattered, the wasted one day of off-work to spend the holiday with my family, and now the humility of the crime of being poor and treasuring a none brand name item that was a gift from a loving wife after saving up one week of paycheck.', 'Southwest-Airlines.hmtl']\n",

Getting on the plane was smooth since people weren't hunting for their seat number. My wife and I sat next to a young lady sitting next to the window to fill out the row. There seemed to be plenty of overhead bin space even with the full flight. We did not take advantage of the free checked luggage that comes with SW since we're use to traveling with carry-on luggage only.  Everyone seemed quite friendly during the trip. Even the other passengers.  Best part, when I went to check-in the website was noting a winter weather advisory for the day we were flying. This was concerning since we had a bit of a drive to visit family after leaving the airport. Southwest's check-in page gave us the option of changing our flight to the next day at no charge! This was a shock to me, never having flown Southwest before. I've had to pay massive fees for any change on other airlines before. (on the same note, I had made a typo on my wife's ticket. The customer service corrected it for me with no problem or charge. - I tried this on another airline before with absolute no luck without a massive change fee.) We changed our flight to the next day with a few clicks online.  Only problem I had was one of the other passengers was wearing perfume. Luckily it wasn't too strong and she was around 6 rows away from me, but my eyes were still burning and I had a sore throat from the reaction (allergic to perfumes) by the time we got to Seattle.

We wanted to sit together on the way home, so we all bit the bullet several days before the flight and paid the $20 upgrade fee. When we printed our boarding passes, we realized that some of us were still in the B group, which meant that, even though they paid the upgrade, early boarding fee, they were not allowed to board until after all the families. They asked the desk about getting a refund and were basically told, too bad. I realize they want to look out for families (especially since there are tons coming and going to Disney), but it's kind of crappy to allow people to pay more knowing full well that they will still be boarding behind at least half of the plane. Maybe they should only sell as many upgrades as there are spaces in Boarding Group A.

Do not go with them because they are cheaper! So many reasons why we had a bad experience with the employees on each flight we took to get back and forth to Mexico and Sacramento.  1.) It started off they switched our initial flight. We had to leave at 6:25am instead of 7:05am and we weren't notified about it until we called to checkin and had to ask someone to drop us off. 2.) The flight from Sacramento 6:25am to Denver, younger attendant with blond wavy hair was servicing back cabin and she was rudely and onerly flirtatious with my new husband on OUR HONEYMOON to the point where it was uncomfortable for both of us and very unprofessional. After the flight when we landed. We told the southwest woman at the landing gate about it. I told her it was our honeymoon and I didnt have the ladys name. She wouldn't tell me the flight attendant's name and said she wasnt allowed. She said she herself has been accused of being flirty because of the southern hospitality and dismissed my complaint. I explained to her how that was professional and was pretty bad to the point where it was uncomfortable and I couldn't argue with the flight attendant during the flight to get kicked off. I asked if they work on tips and treat all honeymooners that way when they are paid to provide service. Also, I said if it would be a woman complaining about a man using the words sexually harassment, it would be treated differently and taken serious to avoid lawsuits. 3.) Flight from Cancun to Denver comming back the brown shorthaired middle aged flight attendant providing service in the front was rude. I told her I had a question, she told me to hold on abruptly and continued to talk to another passenger about a drink. I asked her if they planned on turning off the seatbelt sign so I could go to the bathroom quickly. She answered rudely saying shes not in control of the flight, wont give permission for me to go to the bathroom and cant do anything. I told her I just asked a question and she shrugged her shoulders and walked away. During this whole time 4 people got up and went to the bathroom and she said nothing. I went fast anyways and she gave me a dirty look when I went inside and came out. 4.) We had to recheck our bags from Denver airport to Sacramento flight and nobody could help us where check in our bags and checkin into southwest after we came from Customs. We ran around for at least 20 minutes downstairs and upstairs in circles trying to figure it out and the younger guy at the southwest baggage recheck claim did not give us correct information. 5.) My husband was flagged for flight checkin inside the airport only, for both return flights. I was given group A boarding status and had to try and save him a seat because his groups were B. We barely were able to sit next to eachother during our flights because other people were doing the same thing 6.) Unpacking our bags after our last flight comming back to Sacramento my expensive $50.00 clinique moisture surge cream was unscrewed during the baggage process and spilled all over the luggage bag and stained it. We called and the next day the claim was denied without follow up.  We have submitted an official complaint for everything and were told that they allow 30 days for a response.

I bring one carry-on & two check- in bags both weighing from 35 to 48 lbs a piece and theres no worries about paying an extra fee.

I always make sure my destinations are coordinated with Southwest so I can always have my luggage and not have worry about fees.

One of the reasons is the customer service and how each of the employees make me feel. I haven't seen an employee that seems miserable, but willing to communicate and serve their passengers if needed.  I also like flying with Southwest because of the look of the airplane (especially the updated ones) and the low lighting when you are flying at night.  Lastly, I choose to fly with Southwest because they allow you to bring one carry on bag and one bag that you can put under their seat.

            "['Beware of Powerhungry Ticket agents', 'Date of travel: August 2019', '45', b'We were cancelled at last minute by our original airline American Airline. We were desperate with a lot of money to lose on reservations that was to late to be cancelled so we had to get to our destination. As my husband waited at the American Airline counter to finish up what they needed because of the cancelled flight I went to the Southwest Airline ticket counter. Because there was only one person walking up to the counter and not another person in the line I crawled under the rope to save myself some time and distance. The young man at the counter stated that he was going to take care of the man who was there and I would be next. I completely understood that this man was before me. As I waited, there were two other ticket agents that were talking. I continued to wait and there begin to form a line. Once the two other agents were finished with their conversations the older lady in the middle called for next in line. I went up to the desk and she said that I was not the next in line. I looked at her confused and said \"yes I was standing right there\". She then said that I was not in her line of sight and had to go to the back of the line. I again told her I was standing behind that man at the agent next to her and she told me that I wasn\\'t and to go to the end of the line again. After a couple of back and forth she said she would not wait on me period and to go back to the end of the line. At this point I was just beside myself and just needed tickets to continue on my trip. My husband was approaching at this point so I left as the ticket agent and the one beside her started to laugh. I told my husband what had just happened and he got into the line and waited to buy the tickets. When I asked to speak to a supervisor he was less than helpful stating he wasn\\'t there so he could not do anything about it. Even the young man who was waiting on the first gentleman confirmed my story to the supervisor with no results.  To be fair to Southwest Airlines, once we bought the tickets and went to the gate the experience with the staff of the airline were all top notch. Friendly, helpful, and very personable.

No reason was given and we were not given any immediate instructions as to what to do. I should have suspected something was up when shortly before the cancellation announcement I received an email from Southwest stating that the fee I paid for early-bird check-in was being refunded to me. So everyone from the plane started lining up at the gate agent desk. While waiting in line , I received another email from Southwest telling me that I had been re-booked on a different Southwest flight almost 2 hours later. So I got out of line and went up to the gate agent to ask him if I still needed to wait in my current line and he said yes because I needed a new boarding pass. So while waiting in that long line he made an announcement that if we were already were re-booked that proceeded to my new gate. Unfortunately on my new flight I was unable to keep my A-line boarding priority and ended up sitting at the back of the plane. They did however give me a $100 voucher good for a year. Unfortunately the people who were making connections in Phoenix had to wait for the gate agent to find them an alternative connection. So my conclusion is that the behind the scenes people pushed all the right buttons and the local gate agent of the cancelled flight were not told what what to do immediately, I would have been curious as to the reason for the cancellation but overall was satisfied with how it was handled, especially when the included the $100 voucher.
